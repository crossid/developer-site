### Authenticate

Authenticate users using various authentication methods, from standard user credentials to passwordless authentication.

### Authorize

Authorize your users to access protected APIs and micro-service using JWT-based tokens.

### Access Control

Control users access using fine-grained context aware policies based on assigned roles, attributes and devices.
