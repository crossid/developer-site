description: What is an tenant
---

A tenant is an isolated private namespace that holds all resources related to identity management, such as [applications](./Application), users, groups, etc.

Your tenant URL would be _<tenant_id>_.crossid.io (e.g., "acme.crossid.io")

Typically each organization have a single tenant.

:::note
For b2b companies (such as SAAS), each customer of yours should have its own tenant, see b2b for more info.
